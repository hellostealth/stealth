# Getting Started

Stealth is designed to run on Ruby (MRI) 2.5+

While we don't require any C-based Ruby gems, we haven't yet certified Stealth on other VMs (such as JRuby). However, we do intend to provide official support for JRuby and TruffleRuby soon.

### Installation

You can install Stealth via RubyGems:

```ruby
gem install stealth
```

Next, create your new bot:

```
stealth new <bot_name>
```
