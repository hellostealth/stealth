## Versioning

Stealth follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

While we intend to do our best to ensure that even MAJOR version changes do not introduce breaking changes, we can't guarantee it yet at this point in the project.

Rest assured, though, that all feature deprecations will be either "gently" removed or just permanently deprecated.
